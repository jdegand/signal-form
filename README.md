# Signal Form

## Built with

- [Angular](https://angular.dev)
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.
- [Ng Signal Forms](https://github.com/timdeschryver/ng-signal-forms)

## Thoughts

- Testing a template driven form is more difficult than a reactive form.  Same case here?
